# Retly Operating System üê≥

### Expyremental Retly operating system based on Veonter OS. 
The main part of Retly is to create an operating system where you will not be afraid of data leakage, and most importantly the operating system is open source and you can use it and change something for yourself.
### You must have a debian based linux distribution installed or if you are using a windows operating system, you must have wsl installed.

The distribution itself must have the i686-cross-compiler installed.
